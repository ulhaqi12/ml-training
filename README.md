This repository contains implementation of list of machine learning algorithms from scratch using numpy and pandas only.
#### Note: This repository is not supposed to implement algorithms with best performance rather they are implemented from scratch in simplest way for people who want to get insights of Machine Learning algorithms.

## List of Algorithms Implemented
## Supervised Machine Learning
  - ### Regression
    - Linear Regression with one variable
    - Linear Regression with multiple variables
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Ridge Regression
  - ### Classification
    - Logestic Regression
    - Naive Bayes Classifier (with Gaussian distribution)
    - Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM)
    - Decision Tree Classifier (with ID3 Algorithm)
## Unsupervised Machine Learning
  - K-Means Clustering
